The requirements:
==================

You will need these components to compile Robod: 
    - glib 2.0
    - pthreads
    - libasound1 (0.5.8)
    - gcc and GNU make
    - (flite [the only synthetiser that has working output module now])

Building Robod:
=================

To compile the whole project, including Robod server, all modules
and clients, simply extract the distribution archive and change to 
Robod-<version> directory and run "make all" command as follows:

 $ tar -xzvf robod-@VERSION.tar.gz
 $ cd robod-@VERSION
 $ make all
 
When everything worked ok, you can install all the parts to the default
path by running:

 $ make install

Building in more detail:
========================

The hierarchy of Makefiles is used to build each of the parts. The top
level Makefile allows you to compile some extra parts of the project.
These are:

    - doc ........ build documentation in all supported formats
                   (see doc/README for more information)
    - src/server ..... build speachd server - this is the same as
                   cd src/server; make all
    - src/modules .... build all speachd modules - this is the same as
                   cd src/modules; make all
    - src/clients .... build all clients - this is the same as
                   cd src/clients; make all
    - clean ...... remove all files except the sources (does not
                   clean documentation)
    - all ........ build server, modules and clients
