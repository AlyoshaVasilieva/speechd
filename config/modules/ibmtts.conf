# -- SENTENCE BOUNDARY DETECTION --

# The IBM TTS Output Module does not do sentence boundary
# detection.  These are here for administrative purposes.
# Do not change.

# See Speech Dispatcher manual for more information.

# TODO: These are ignored right now.  Remove if not implemented in ibmtts.c

# -- AUDIO OUTPUT --

# Chooses between three possible sound output systems:
#       "oss"  - Open Sound System
#       "alsa" - Advanced Linux Sound System
#       "nas"  - Network Audio System
# NAS provides a better volume setting and supports playing
# multiple streams on one soundcard, so you, for example,
# can have speech synthesis enabled and simultaneously
# listen to some music. But the NAS libraries had to be
# present when compiling Speech Dispatcher, otherwise you
# won't be able to use NAS.
# Recent ALSA implementations also support multiple streams
# on one soundcard.
# OSS, ALSA and NAS specific options follow.

IbmttsAudioOutputMethod "alsa"

# What OSS device to use when Open Sound System is
# chosen for the audio output.

#IbmttsOSSDevice "/dev/dsp"

# What ALSA device to use when Advanced Linux Sound Architecture is
# chosen for the audio output.  You should choose a device
# that supports the dmix plugin, such as "default" or
# "default:1" for the second sound card.

#IbmttsALSADevice "default"

# Route to the Network Audio System server when NAS
# is chosen for the audio output. Note that NAS
# server doesn't need to run on your machine,
# you can use it also over network (for instance
# when working on remote machines).

#IbmttsNASServer "tcp/localhost:5450"

# Controls the audio buffer callback size from IBM TTS sythesizer.
# Too small, and voice will sound choppy.

#IbmttsAudioChunkSize 20000

# -- DEBUG --

# Debug turns debugging on or off
# See speechd.conf for information where debugging information is stored.

# TODO: Change this to 0 and comment out for final release.

Debug 1

# DebugFile specifies the file where the debugging information
# should be stored (note that the log is overwritten each time
# the module starts)

# DebugFile "/tmp/debug-ibmtts"

# -- VOICES --

# Maps a language code and standard Speech Dispatcher voice to an
# IBM TTS voice dialect.
# See the Speech Dispatcher manual for standard voice names.
# The Dialect must be one of the dialects listed in the DIALECTS section below.

# TODO: Fill in the rest of the language codes and voices.
