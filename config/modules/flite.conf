# -- AUDIO OUTPUT --

# Chooses between three possible sound output systems:
#       "oss"  - Open Sound System
#       "alsa" - Advanced Linux Sound System
#       "nas"  - Network Audio System
# ALSA is default and recommended. The recent implementations
# support mixing of multiple streams. OSS is only provided
# for compatibility with architectures that do not include ALSA.
# NAS is an audio server with higher level of controll over
# your audio stream, with the possibility to stream your audio
# over the network to a different computer and other advanced
# features. (The NAS backend is not very well tested however.)

FliteAudioOutputMethod "alsa"

# What OSS device to use when Open Sound System was
# chosen for the audio output.

#FliteOSSDevice "/dev/dsp"

# Route to the Network Audio System server when NAS
# was chosen for the audio output. Note that NAS
# server doesn't need to run on your machine,
# you can use it also over network (for instance
# when working on remote machines).

#FliteNASServer "tcp/localhost:5450"

# Debug turns debugging on or off
# See speechd.conf for information where debugging information is stored

# Debug 0


# DebugFile specifies the file where the debugging information
# should be stored (note that the log is overwritten each time
# the module starts)
# DebugFile "/tmp/debug-flite"
