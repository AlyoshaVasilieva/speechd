Short-term goals
=================

        * Index marking support in SSIP.

        * Sound output that supports OSS, Alsa and some sound server
          instead of the hardcoded OSS output (Any help with this highly
          appreciated!)

Longer-term goals
=================

	* Decide what to do with history. 

We don't know how to do it (external help needed)
=================================================

	* RPM packaging
