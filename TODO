Short-term goals
================

	* default port ... find a suitable port number without any conflict.

	* modularize TTS functionality ... Speech Dispatcher now contains some TTS-like
       functionality, but it is desirable not to include it in server core.  It
       should be available as an external module.

	* client configuration ... enable to override certain configuration options
	   based on client/connection name.

	* default (language independent tables) + add to NEWS

	* finish/rework documentation of output modules

	* reset parameters when reconnecting to Festival server

Longer-term goals
=================

	* clear CVS
	* translate documentation to Czech
	* debugging ... focus on segfaults
	* documentation ... finish.
	* volume setting for synthetizers

	* Sorting in history.
	* HISTORY commands and their return values (more...)

	* (History should be saved to disk when Speech Dispatcher terminates)

We don't know how to do it (external help needed)
=================================================
	* noises/cracking ... Festival + MBROLA + Czech language makes some strange
	   noises while speakig.
	* install output modules with debugging symbols (not stripped)
	* RPM packaging
	* documentation how to install MBROLA with Festival and Speech Dispatcher
