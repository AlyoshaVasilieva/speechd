        * Index marking support in SSIP.

        * Index marking and improved commmunication in Festival output
   module.

        * Sound output that supports OSS, Alsa and some sound server
   instead of the hardcoded OSS output (Any help with this highly
   appreciated!)

Longer-term goals
=================

        * Identd authentication.

	* HISTORY commands and their return values (more...)

	* History should be saved to disk when Speech Dispatcher terminates

We don't know how to do it (external help needed)
