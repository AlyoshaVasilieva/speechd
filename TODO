================

	/ reset parameters when reconnecting to Festival server

	* default port ... find a suitable port number without any conflict.

	* clear CVS


Longer-term goals
=================

	* debugging ... focus on segfaults
	* documentation ... finish.
	* volume setting for synthetizers

	* Sorting in history.
	* HISTORY commands and their return values (more...)

	* (History should be saved to disk when Speech Dispatcher terminates)

We don't know how to do it (external help needed)
