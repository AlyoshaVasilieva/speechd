Speech Dispatcher 0.8.7
=====================

Announcing the availability of Speech Dispatcher 0.8.7 developed as a part of
the Free(b)Soft project.

* What is new in 0.8.7?

 - Further fixes to spd-conf, which should now work properly.

 - Split the espeak-ng driver code into its own source file.

 - Add a work-around to the espeak-ng driver to account for spaces in voice 
   names which recently appeared in espeak-ng git master. This will properly
   be fixed in 0.9.

 - Voice names are not forced to lower case, due to espeak-ng git master now
   having multi-case voice names.

 - Fix stripped audio output from the flite module, thanks to Samuel Thibault.

 - Further code and build improvements.

* What is Speech Dispatcher?

  Speech Dispatcher is a device independent layer for speech
  synthesis, developed with the goal of making the usage of speech
  synthesis easier for application programmers. It takes care of most
  of the tasks necessary to solve in speech enabled applications. What
  is a very high level GUI library to graphics, Speech Dispatcher is
  to speech synthesis.

  Key Speech Dispatcher features are:

  - Message priority model that allows multiple simultaneous
    connections to Speech Dispatcher from one or more clients
    and tries to provide the user with the most important messages.

  - Different output modules that talk to different synthesizers so
    that the programmer doesn't need to care which particular
    synthesizer is being used. Currently Festival, Flite, Epos, Espeak
    and (non-free) Dectalk software, IBM TTS, Pico and others are
    supported. Festival is an advanced Free Software synthesizer
    supporting various languages. Espeak is a very fast multi-lingual
    Free Software synthesizer.

  - Simple interface for programs written in C, C++ provided through a
    shared library. Python, Common Lisp and Guile interfaces. An Elisp
    and Java libraries are developed as sperate projects speechd-el
    and speechd-java. Possibly an interface to any other language can
    be developed.
