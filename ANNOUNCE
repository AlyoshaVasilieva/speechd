The Brailcom organization is happy to announce the availability of Speech
Dispatcher 0.6.5 developed as a part of the Free(b)Soft project. This
is a minor release, it contains mostly bugfixes and minor improvements.
Please read `What is new' and `NOTES' bellow.

* What is Speech Dispatcher?

  Speech Dispatcher is a device independent layer for speech
  synthesis, developed with the goal of making the usage of speech
  synthesis easier for application programmers. It takes care of most
  of the tasks necessary to solve in speech enabled applications. What
  is a very high level GUI library to graphics, Speech Dispatcher is
  to speech synthesis.

  The architecture of Speech Dispatcher is based on a proven
  client/server model. The basic means of client communication
  with Speech Dispatcher is through a TCP connection using the Speech
  Synthesis Interface Protocol (SSIP).

  Key Speech Dispatcher features are:

  - Message priority model that allows multiple simultaneous
    connections to Speech Dispatcher from one or more clients
    and tries to provide the user with the most important messages.

  - Different output modules that talk to different synthesizers
    so that the programmer doesn't need to care which particular
    synthesizer is being used. Currently Festival, Flite, Epos, Espeak
    and (non-free) Dectalk software, IBM TTS are supported. Festival
    is an advanced Free Software synthesizer supporting various languages.
    Espeak is a very fast multi-lingual synthesizer.

  - Client-based configuration allows users to configure different
    settings for different clients that connect to Speech Dispatcher.

  - Simple interface for programs written in C, C++ provided through a
    shared library. Python, Common Lisp and Guile interface. An Elisp library
    is developed as a sperate project speechd-el. Possibly an interface
    to any other language can be developed.

* What is new in 0.6.5?

 - Pulse Audio output module.

 - Speech Dispatcher is now adapted for easy setup and using
   under ordinary system user accounts.

 - Bugfixes.

 NOTES (0.6.5)

   - There are changes in the configuration file. It is highly
     recommended to replace your speechd.conf file with the
     speechd.conf provided in this package and copy your settings
     there. The old configuration file should however also work.

   - Default output module has been switched to espeak.

   - If you want to use Pulse Audio, specify the 'pulse' option as
     audio method in the configuration of Dispatcher output
     modules. Given the design of Pulse Audio mixing, you will have to
     run Speech Dispatcher under your user account, not under the root
     or speech-dispatcher account. Please read
