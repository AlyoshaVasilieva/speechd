Speech Dispatcher 0.8.5
=====================

Announcing the availability of Speech Dispatcher 0.8.5 developed as a part of
the Free(b)Soft project.

* What is new in 0.8.5?

 - More unused code removal.

 - Fix more compiler warnings.

 - Use GLib main loop for the main server thread. This simplifies code alot,
   and allows for future improvements, particularly related to configuration.

 - Implement a shutdown timer in the server. This shuts the server down after
   5 seconds by default when no clients are connected. The timer is
   deactivated as soon as a client connects.

 - Add support for espeak-ng.

 - Document an ibmtts configuration option which was in the code, but not in
   the config file.

 - Removal of configuration options in the code that were not actually being
   used.

 - Added a command-line argument to allow for custom modules location. This
   may be expanded in the future to allow for multiple paths to be specified.

* What is Speech Dispatcher?

  Speech Dispatcher is a device independent layer for speech
  synthesis, developed with the goal of making the usage of speech
  synthesis easier for application programmers. It takes care of most
  of the tasks necessary to solve in speech enabled applications. What
  is a very high level GUI library to graphics, Speech Dispatcher is
  to speech synthesis.

  Key Speech Dispatcher features are:

  - Message priority model that allows multiple simultaneous
    connections to Speech Dispatcher from one or more clients
    and tries to provide the user with the most important messages.

  - Different output modules that talk to different synthesizers so
    that the programmer doesn't need to care which particular
    synthesizer is being used. Currently Festival, Flite, Epos, Espeak
    and (non-free) Dectalk software, IBM TTS, Pico and others are
    supported. Festival is an advanced Free Software synthesizer
    supporting various languages. Espeak is a very fast multi-lingual
    Free Software synthesizer.

  - Simple interface for programs written in C, C++ provided through a
    shared library. Python, Common Lisp and Guile interfaces. An Elisp
    and Java libraries are developed as sperate projects speechd-el
    and speechd-java. Possibly an interface to any other language can
    be developed.
