A list of known bugs:

 - All history functions are now in problems, because we don't
stop all messages when the client is gone. This causes problems
with fdset which is freed on client_close(). We should use rather
history_fdset as a hash table using a composed key of both fd and uid.
spd_center often crashes Speech Deamon because of this.

 - SSIP isn't stabilized yet, it's going to change. The current
protocol isn't described in documentation yet.
