A list of known bugs:

* There is some problem with (probably) closing connection
to festival server which causes that Speech Dispatcher can't
be executed immediatelly after it was suspended if the
Festival output plugin was in use in the last Speech Dispatcher
run. We send "(quit)" to festival server and close() the
socket, but it doesn't seem to be enough :(

* You can define only *one* generic plugin. If you try to define
more, the results are undefined. This is a problem with loading
libraries into memmory (shared or separeted when they are loaded
more than once) and it will fix itself when we switch to the new
design of output modules quite soon.
