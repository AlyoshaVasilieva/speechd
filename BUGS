A list of known bugs:

* There is some problem with (probably) closing connection
to festival server which causes that Speech Dispatcher can't
be executed immediatelly after it was suspended if the
Festival output plugin was in use in the last Speech Dispatcher
run. We send "(quit)" to festival server and close() the
socket, but it doesn't seem to be enough :(
