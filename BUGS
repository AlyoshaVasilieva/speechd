A list of known bugs:

* The Flite output module doesn't support sound icons and spelling
as there is not any support for that in Flite.

* The Festival output module occasionally crashes under mysterious
circumstances. This might somehow be connected with the ALSA output, but it is
very difficult to track down under the current architecture. The issue will be
revisited after porting the module under TTS API. Accept our apologies.

* The BLOCK command currently doesn't interface correctly with the
priority PROGRESS. Only the last message in the block is guaranteed
to work correctly as the progress-termination message. Will be fixed
in the next major release.
