A list of known bugs:

* The Flite output module doesn't support sound icons and spelling
as there is not any support for that in Flite.

* Espeak generic module doesn't support punctuation.

* The BLOCK command currently doesn't interface correctly with the
priority PROGRESS. Only the last message in the block is guaranteed
to work correctly as the progress-termination message. Will be fixed
in the next major release.
