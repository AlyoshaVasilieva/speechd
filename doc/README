All project documentation is written using DocBook XML.
See http://www.docbook.org for more information about DocBook.

The Makefile in this directory allows you to build the documentation from
XML sources in one of these formats: HTML, RTF, TeX and  MIF.

HTML is the only format which is included in distribution files by default.

To build one of supported formats, run "make <format>", Where <format> is
supplyed by name of the format in lowercase.

The make process REQUIRES:

 * Jade .... a free tool that applies DSSSL stylesheets to SGML and XML
   documents. Jade homesite is at http://www.jclark.com/jade/

 * DocBook DTD V4.1.2. XML .... a DTD maintained by the DocBook Technical 
   Committee of OASIS (http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/)

 * ModularDocBook Stylesheets .... Norman Walsh maintains two DSSSL
   stylesheets for DocBook, one for print and one for online (HTML)
   output. You can obtain both of these stylesheets from
   http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/

You can also install these packages to your Linux Distribution as follows:

Debian:
    * docbook-xml
    * jade (and jade-tex if you want TeX output)
    * docbook-stylesheets
    * sgml-base sgml-data and sgml-tools is also required
    
RedHat:
    * docbook-xml
    * jade
    * stylesheets
    * sgml-common and sgml-tools is also required
