@code{spd-say} is a very simple client for Speech Dispatcher that takes some text from the
command line and some simple parameters and passes them to Speech Dispatcher
for synthesis. The resulting synthesized speech is then played on your speakers.
It can also be used for stopping and cancelling speech on Speech Dispatcher.

Usage: @code{spd-say [options] "some text"}


@table @code
@item -r or --rate
Set the rate of the speech (between -100 and +100, 0 is default).
@item -p or --pitch
Set the pitch of the speech (between -100 and +100, 0 is default).
@item -i or --volume
Set the volume (intensity) of the speech (between -100 and +100, 0 is default).
@item -o or --output-module
Set the output module.
@item -l or --language
Set the language. The parameter is an iso language code, like @code{en} or @code{cs}.
@item -t or --voice-type
Set the prefered voice type (male1, male2, male3, female1, female2,
female3, child_male, child_female).
@item -m or --punctuation-mode
Set the punctuation mode (none, some, all).
@item -s or --spelling
Spell the message
@item -x or --ssml
Set SSML mode on (default: off).  The text contains SSML markup.
@item -w or --wait
Wait till the end of speaking the message. In this mode, spd-say returns only after
the message is fully spoken on the speakers or after it gets discarded.
@item -S or --stop
Stop the previous message in Speech Dispatcher (regardless of the client who sent
it and it's priority) before saying the specified message. If no message is specified,
it just performs the stop function.
@item -C or --cancel
Similar to @code{-S}, but it stops (cancels) all the messages in all the queues in
Speech Dispatcher. Use this for total stop of speech.
@item -v or --version
Print version and copyright info.
@item -h or --help
Print a short help message.
