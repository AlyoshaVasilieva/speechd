Q:  During the instalation, when running `make' and `make install',
I get some strange message from libtool and the process crashes:
	../../libtool: s%^.*/%%: is not a file or directory
    ../../libtool: -e: command not found
    ../../libtool: -e: command not found
	(repeating several times)

A:  Libtool uses `sed' as it's tool to modify text, but the new versions
rely on the environment variable SED to contain the name of the command
to call. This variable must be set when building programs using these versions
of libtool. You can run make like that (if you have `sed' in your PATH):
	$ SED=sed make
	$ su root
	$ SED=sed make install
or
	$ export SED=sed
	$ make
	$ su root
	$ make install
