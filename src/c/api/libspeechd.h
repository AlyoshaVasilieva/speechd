	/* This is the header file for the libspeechd library.
	 * If you are reading this, you are either a developer
	 * of Speech Deamon, a (potential) developer of some
	 * application and you want it to speak, or just an
	 * interested user who wants to learn. In all these
	 * cases, I'll try to explain you how this works and
	 * how Speech Deamon could help you. Right here, right
	 * now. You can also see the documentation for reference,
	 * but this *inline* documentation is probably more
	 * complete and up-to-date. If you are new to this
	 * speech interface, we recommend you to start reading
	* it from top to down, not skipping.*/

	/* I'll suppose you know what Speech Deamon is and how
	 * does it work (more or less) internally. If not,
	 * you should have a look at the general documentation
	 * in ../../doc and maybe also at .../server/speechd.h */

	/* From the point of view of a developer who wants
	 * to use Speech Deamon as his output interface,
	 * the basic things you'll have to do are the following:
	 * 	- you must include this header file in your program
	 * 	- you must link with -llibspeechd
	 *  - you should let the user know (eg. in documentation)
	 *  you suppose he'll have Speech Deamon running when your
	 *  program starts
	 */

	/* Speech Deamon operates as a server internally and
	 * your app will be a client. So in some point in
	 * your sourcecode you have to open the connection,
	 * passing some necessary identification parameters.
	 */
int spd_init(char* client_name, char* conn_name);
	/* For the purpose of further communication with speech
	 * interface, you will receive an identification code (file
	 * descriptor) of the opened socket as the return value.
	 * But what do _client_name_ and _conn_name_ stand for?
	 * Well, these are two strings that Speech Deamon uses for
	 * the identification of your client. It will be
	 * particularly useful for the user for settings
	 * of the synthesis parameters and also for browsing
	 * through history of said messages (eg. for visually
	 * impaired people).
	 *
	 * The first, _client_name_, is some general name for your
	 * app (eg. "lynx", "emacs", "vi", "bash"), while the
	 * seccond one, _conn_name_ is some more detailed description
	 * of what should this particular client do (eg. "main",
	 * "cmd_line", "text_buffer", "menu", "status_bar"). 
	 *
	 * The reason is that if you have a more complicated
	 * program, like emacs definitely is, it's a good
	 * idea not to mess all the messages together, but
	 * maintain several different connections each
	 * for a particular purpose. You will then make
	 * your user's life much easier, because he will
	 * be able to set the speech parameters for different
	 * part of you program differently. For example,
	 * a blind person would appreciate if he or she
	 * could set up the cmd_line connection of your
	 * program so that it always spells the input
	 * while the text_buffer will always speak
	 * fluently, by default.
	 *
	 * By conclusion, you should open several connections
	 * to Speeach Deamon, each with the same _client_name_
	 * but with different _conn_name_, and save the returned
	 * connection fd's (file descriptors) 
	 *
	 * But take care, if it returns -1, then it failed
	 * to estabilish a connection and you can't use it!
	 */

	 /* Each connection you open should be closed before
	  * the end of your program. You simply pass it's
	  * file descriptor to spd_close() */
void spd_close(int fd);

	/* Now let's suppose you have succesfully opened
	 * one or more connections, saved it's fd's
	 * and you want to make some fun. The basic thing
	 * you can do is to send some message to Speech
	 * Deamon and if everything goes well, you will
	 * hear it in your speakers. */
int spd_say(int fd, int priority, char* text);
	/* _fd_ is the file descriptor of the connection
	 * you want to use, _text_ is a NULL-terminated
	 * string containing your message. 
	 * 
	 * But there is one more parameter called _priority_,
	 * the reason is, sometimes some messages are more
	 * important than other ones. For example, your app
	 * is a mail client and it's reading a text of a mail
	 * when suddenly you receive an important error.
	 * So you will naturally want to say it with priority
	 * one so that it supresses the currently spoken text.
	 *
	 * There are three priorities 1,2,3. 2 is the normal
	 * for text, menu output and other things. 3 is the
	 * lowest and it should represent messages that can
	 * help the user if there is nothing else to say, but
	 * aren't important and can be supressed at any time.
	 * Well, the priority one is the most powerfull and
	 * you should use it scarcely, important errors are
	 * a good example of a well-founded use. It supresses
	 * all other messages, even from other clients, and
	 * thus it's a little bit dangerous.
	 *
	 * If there are more than one message of the same
	 * priority at one time, they would be said in
	 * the order they were received. 
	 *
	 * It returns 0 on succes, -1 if something failed.*/

	/* spd_sayf is only a shortcut, very similar to
	 * spd_say() (see spd_say() for the detailed description
	 * of it's parameters).
	 *
	 * The good thing about it is that you can call it in
	 * exactly the same way you are used to call printf()
	 * for screen output. */

	 *		spd_sayf(fd_main, 2, "Your rate was %d words per minute.", wpm);
	 */

	/* stop, pause and resume are the functions you will
	 * want to use to regulate the speech flow. */

	/* spd_stop() immediatelly stops the currently spoken
	 * message (from this client) but doesn't touch the others
	 * that are waiting in queues. However, it isn't pause() so any
	 * other received messages will be said normally. 
	 * _fd_ is the file descriptor of your connection. */
int spd_stop(int fd);
	/* It returns 0 on succes, -1 if there is no such connection. */

        /* If you want to stop the currently spoken message
         * and in adition to stop all the messages waiting
         * in queues, please use spd_cancel() */
int spd_cancel(int fd);
	/* It returns 0 on succes, -1 if there is no such connection. */

	/* Both return 0 on succes, -1 if there is no such connection. */

	/* Speech Deamon supports a facility called sound icons.
	 * Sound icons are a language independent objects that

	 * depends on the current language and can be also set by
	 * user. */

int spd_icon(int fd,  char *name);

	 * as _c_ and Speech Deamon will find the appropiate sound
	 * icon.
	 * It returns 0 on succes, -1 otherwise. */

	/* The spd_voice_ family of commands can be used to set the

	 * and the user is free to set different parameters. */
int spd_voice_rate(int fd, int rate);
int spd_voice_pitch(int fd, int pitch);
	/* spd_voice_rate() and spd_voice_pitch() set the rate and the pitch
	 * of the voice respectively to the value passed in the second parameter.
	 * It must be between -100 and +100. 0 is the default value representing
	 * normal speech. Speech Deamon will then try to find the most appropiate
	 * values for each synthesizers. 
	 * Both functions return 0 on succes, -1 otherwise. */

	/* If punctuation mode is on, Speech Deamon will make the synthesizer
	 * pronounce even marks that are normally silent, like coma, dash, or dot. */
int spd_voice_punctuation(int fd, int flag);
	/* If flag is set to 1, the punctuation mode is on, 0 means off.

	 * and capital letters in the pronounced text. */
int spd_voice_cap_let_recognition(int fd, int flag);

	 * 0 means normal speech.

	/* If you are going to use Speech Deamon to make your application
	 * accessible to visually impaired people (which is The Good
	 * Thing (tm) !), you can use this function for all
	 * command line oriented text input: */
char* spd_command_line(int fd, char *buffer, int pos, int c);
	/* Now how it works: you have to use it in a loop, each time
	 * you catch a newly typed key, you call this function and pass
	 * it what's currently on the line as _buffer_, the current
	 * position of cursor on the line as _pos_ and the new key
	 * as _c_. Why so dificult you ask? Well, because it's interface
	 * independent. You can for example use it with ncurses, or even
	 * in X where it would fail if we would have some printf() hardwired
	 * here.
	 * 
	 * Here is an example from Speech Deamon Center (using ncurses library):
	 *     do{
	 *        c = getch();
	 *        if (c==KEY_TAB){
	 *           buffer = spdc_complete(buffer, (buffer!=NULL)?strlen(buffer):0,

	/* It returns 0 on succes, -1 if something went wrong. */

	/* So it's time to present the misterious spd_get_client_list()
	 * function, I guess.*/

	 * Now client_names[i] (where i is less than the return value) is the
	 * name of the i-th client in the form "client_name:conn_name", client_ids[i]
