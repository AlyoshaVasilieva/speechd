@ Hi, this is a basic Speech Deamon test.

@ I've succesfully connected to the server
@ and now I'm going to try to set my client name
@ and priority for the messages.

!SET SELF CLIENT_NAME unknown_user:test-basic:main

!SET SELF PRIORITY 2

@ Hope it was ok. Now I can try to say something:

!SPEAK
Hello world, this is Speech Deamon speaking.

@ If you heard the full message, Speech Deamon
@ works correctly.

@ Now we will try some settings.

@ This message should be said very quickly...

!SET SELF RATE +80
!SPEAK
You have to run as fast as you can just to stay where you are.
If you want to get anywhere, you'll have to run much faster.

@ ...and this very slowly.

!SET SELF RATE -80
!SPEAK
There is more to life than increasing its speed.
        -- Mahatma Gandhi

@ We will keep the rate at this level and try to make the voice
@ whisper by increasing its pitch.

!SET SELF PITCH 90
!SPEAK
Do not believe in miracles -- rely on them.

@ If the tests did what expected, your instalation of Speech Deamon
@ probably works fine. If not, there can be different causes, see
@ the documentation -- Troubleshooting. (Note that some synthesizers
@ don't have to support setting of the voice parameters. If everything
@ other worked correctly, this is not a fatal problem.).
