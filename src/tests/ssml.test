@ Hi, this is a test for SSML support in Speech Dispatcher.

@ Note that not all synthesizers (output modules) support SSML.
@ If they do not, they should still speak but should not speak any
@ of the SSML tags.

@ We'll begin with a simple message.
$4
!SET SELF SSML_MODE ON
!SPEAK
<speak>
S S M L or Speech Synthesis Markup Language is an XML
language that provides authors of synthesizable content a standard way
to control aspects of speech such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, rate,
etc. across different synthesis-capable platforms.
</speak>
. 
$16
@ If you heard the full message, Speech Dispatcher
@ works correctly.
$2


@ Now we will try changing the volume in mid-sentence.
$2
!SPEAK
<speak>
This sentence starts out normally, <prosody volume="loud">
but then speaks loudly,</prosody><prosody volume="soft">
and ends very softly.</prosody>
</speak>
.
$8

!QUIT

@ If the tests did what was expected, your installation of Speech Dispatcher
@ probably works fine. If not, there can be different causes, see
@ the documentation -- Troubleshooting. (Note that some synthesizers
@ don't support SSML. If everything
@ else worked correctly, this is not a fatal problem.).
