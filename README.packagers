Notes for packagers of Speech Dispatcher.

The python bindings distributed in this release in directory
src/api/python/speechd/ have been ported to Python 3 and are backward
incompatible with Python 2. For applications relying on the Python
bindings, such as the Orca screen reader, to be compatible with this
release, a version must be used which runs on Python 3.

Please make sure to setup the package dependencies correctly
to avoid possible problems.
