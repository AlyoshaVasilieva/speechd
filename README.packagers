Notes for packagers of Speech Dispatcher.

Speech Dispatcher now includes an output module for the IBM TTS synthesizer.

In order to build the ibmtts output module, you will need one of two things:

  1.  An install of the commercial IBM TTS synthesizer (for Linux), or

  2.  The sdk for IBM TTS, which contains the headers and a "stub library" for
      linking against.  The sdk can be obtained here:

      http://ibmtts-sdk.sourceforge.net/

      It isn't obvious on that website, but you download the sdk using cvs:

      cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ibmtts-sdk login 

      cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ibmtts-sdk co
        -P sdk

      The sdk is licensed using a BSD-style license.

You will also need libsndfile in order to enable sound icon emulation with the
ibmtts output module.  (As of Apr 2006, the Debian packages you need are
libsndfile1 and libsndfile1-dev.)  If you build with libsndfile, be sure that
is a DEPENDS in your package.
