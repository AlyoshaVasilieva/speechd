Notes for packagers of Speech Dispatcher.

The communication mechanism of Speech Dispatcher and the way of starting it has been severely
reworked in this release.  Some ./configure variables as PIDPATH are no longer relevant. It is
highly recommended to start Speech Dispatcher per-user in his user session and avoid starting
it as a system service via /etc/init.d/. Please check the updated documentation, especially the
part Technical Specification.
